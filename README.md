# Getting Started with Vite.js

This project was migrated from Create React App (CRA) to Vite.js.

## Introduction

Vite.js is a fast and lightweight development server and build tool for modern web applications. It aims to provide an optimized development experience with fast startup times and instant hot module replacement (HMR) for a smooth development workflow. Vite.js leverages ES modules and native browser capabilities to eliminate the need for a bundler during development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.
